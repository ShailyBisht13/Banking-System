The Banking System project is a simple yet functional console-based application developed using C++. It simulates basic operations of a bank, allowing users to create and manage bank accounts, perform transactions, and view account details. The system uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, and file handling to store and retrieve account data.
This project helps demonstrate practical implementation of C++ programming concepts in a real-world scenario, making it an ideal beginner-to-intermediate level project.
